"""Group E — Conflict Detection.

E4 is deterministic and ships now. E1/E2 (the group's reason for existing) and
E3 need rule extraction plus the judge harness; they are registered as stubs so
the CLI reports them as not-yet-implemented rather than silently omitting them.

Clustering note for when E1/E2 land: naive pairwise comparison over the extracted
rules is tens of thousands of judge calls. Bucket by `subject`, then compare only
pairs whose `actor` sets intersect, and skip pairs with identical modality AND
predicate (that is D2's job). For Set 4 this lands in the low hundreds.
