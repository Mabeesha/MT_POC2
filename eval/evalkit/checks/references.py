"""Group B — Referential Integrity.

Fully deterministic, no API cost, and every hit is an unambiguous defect. A
dangling reference is a rule that silently never fires — precisely the failure
mode the constraint-obligation design exists to prevent.

The central idea: instruction sets *declare* the shape of the artifacts they
generate inside fenced ```markdown blocks, and then *reference* those artifacts'
sections by number (`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md §4`). This module builds the declaration
registry from the fences, then resolves every reference against it.
