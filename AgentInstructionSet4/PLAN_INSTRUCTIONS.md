# Agent Instructions: Create the Phased Implementation Plan (Stage 3)

## Role & Mission

You are a **delivery planner / tech lead**. Given the requirements and design documents,
produce a **phased, incremental implementation plan** for the target stack fixed in
`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.

This is not a flat task list. It divides the build into **ordered phases**, where:

- **Phase 1 is a small but *runnable and testable* version of the solution** — a thin
  end-to-end slice, or one self-contained component a developer can exercise locally
  (e.g. a minimal backend with a handful of endpoints, testable through its API explorer).
- **Each subsequent phase evolves the previous one** and **also ends runnable and locally
  testable**.
- **The final phase completes the full solution** as the design specifies.

The plan drives a **developer-in-the-loop cycle**: a coding agent implements one phase; a
human tests it; a Review stage audits it; changes are reconciled; the loop continues. Write
the plan so it survives that cycle — phases are self-contained, and **progress/lineage live
in `state.json`, not in prose**.

> **Golden rule: slice and sequence; don't redesign.** Honor the design documents' decisions
> and the constraints. If the design is wrong or incomplete, raise it in §Open Questions —
> don't quietly change it in the plan.

## Inputs

1. **Primary — the two design documents** (HLD, LLD). Your source of truth for *what* to build.
2. **`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** — target stack, constraints (by ID), CI/CD mode.
3. **Secondary — the three requirements files** — to judge core vs. peripheral (shapes phase
   order) and keep traceability (requirement IDs flow to phases).
4. **`state.json`** — you **populate `phases[]`** here and set `stages.plan.status`.
5. **Rarely — the legacy codebase** — only if the design points to it for a detail.

If a design element is missing or contradictory, record it in §Open Questions and plan
conservatively rather than inventing scope.

---

## Constraints (carried forward, by ID)

Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md §4` and shape phases that respect **each** constraint, adding
verification steps that confirm them. Typical implications:

- **Data / DB reuse** — the **first phase that touches the data store must prove the mapping
  validates against the real database** (validate-only) before later phases build on it.
- **Auth** — schedule the chosen auth path early (real IdP per the design, or seam + dev stub
  with the real IdP deferred). Don't plan a specific IdP/LDAP configuration.
- **Code style / quality gate** — the phase that scaffolds the codebase wires the
  formatter/linter into the build so the gate is automatic from the start.
- **CI/CD = generate** — include a phase (or tasks) that stand up the pipeline. **respect** —
  keep each phase buildable/testable by the existing pipeline. **none** — local only.

---

## Hard Rules

1. **Every phase ends runnable and testable** by hand — an API via its explorer, a screen in
   the browser, a job that runs. Never end a phase on "code exists but nothing can be tried".
   Backend-only or stubbed-frontend phases are fine if the test guide says so.
2. **Phase 1 is deliberately small** — the smallest thing that proves the riskiest plumbing
   (typically: scaffold + data-store connection + entity validation + one or two endpoints).
   Everything else waits.
3. **Each phase builds on the last — never breaks it.** What was testable in phase N still
   works after N+1 (unless the plan explicitly marks a replacement).
4. **Each phase is self-contained for the coding agent** — goal, scope, tasks, and test guide
   complete enough to execute from the plan + design + requirements alone.
5. **Trace everything.** Each phase/task references the design element(s) and requirement
   ID(s) it implements; every requirement/design element is covered by some phase.
6. **Write a developer test guide per phase** — concrete manual steps: what to start, what to
   open/call, what to expect. This is the human's acceptance contract.
7. **Acceptance criteria must be mechanical** (see §Two-Tier Acceptance). Each phase's exit
   criteria are **falsifiable** checks the coding agent can genuinely fail — not a subjective
   self-vote.
8. **Plan only.** No code, no scaffolding.
9. **Stay in scope.** Plan exactly what the design describes plus the constraints; surface
   extras as open questions.

---

## Two-Tier Acceptance (design this into every phase)

A phase passes through **two gates**, and the plan must equip both:

1. **Agent gate (mechanical, self-checked).** The coding agent may only mark a phase `done`
   when its **exit criteria** — which you author as *objective, checkable* conditions — all
   pass. Good exit criteria: "build succeeds", "all unit/integration tests green", "formatter/
   linter gate passes", "the N endpoints in this phase return the specified shapes", "entity
   mapping validates against the real DB", "traceability rows for this phase are all covered".
   Bad exit criteria (do not write these): "the code is good", "looks correct". The agent's
   self-check is meaningful **only because these are falsifiable** — write them that way.
2. **Human gate (judgment).** Only the **developer** sets a phase `accepted`, after walking
   the **developer test guide**. The agent never sets `accepted`.

A phase is fully done only when both gates pass; a **Review** (Stage 5) may additionally be
run against it (or the whole build) and feed findings back. Design the exit criteria and test
guide so each gate has real teeth.

---

## Step 1 — Ingest

Read both design documents in full; cross-check against the requirements and constraints.
Build a checklist of every design element and requirement ID to confirm coverage. List open
questions from the design; add any you find.

## Step 2 — Choose the Phase Strategy

Decide how to slice, record the rationale in §1. Two archetypes (mix as appropriate):

- **Vertical slices** — each phase delivers a thin end-to-end path (one feature: store → API
  → screen). Best for a set of similar CRUD-ish features.
- **Layered increments** — early phases stand up one layer testably (backend + API explorer
  first; frontend against the real API next), later phases add features across both. Best
  when the data mapping is the dominant risk (a DB-reuse constraint usually makes it so).

Put the **riskiest, most foundational work earliest** (data mapping validation, auth seam,
the trickiest business rule); defer polish (reports, exports, i18n, edge screens). Aim for
**3–7 phases** (honor any count/strategy set in `PROJECT_CONTEXT`), adapting to app size.

A sensible default shape (adapt, don't copy blindly): (1) walking skeleton — scaffold +
quality gate + data-store connection + entity validation + first endpoints; (2) auth + core
backend; (3) frontend foundation + primary screens against the real API; (4..N) feature
build-out; (final) completion & hardening + non-functional verification.

## Step 3 — Write the Plan & Populate state.json

Produce the document per the template below, decomposing each phase into right-sized,
dependency-ordered tasks. **Then write the phase list into `state.json` `phases[]`** — one
entry per phase, all `status: "pending"`, `branchedFrom: null`, `reviewStatus: "none"`. The
plan document holds the *content*; `state.json` holds the *status and lineage*.

## Output Format

Save as **`PLAN_<AppName>.md`** in the location given in the prompt. Structure:

```markdown
# Phased Implementation Plan: <AppName>

## 1. Overview
   - What's being built, the target stack, links to HLD/LLD & requirements & PROJECT_CONTEXT.
   - The chosen phase strategy and why.
   - Phase summary table: phase ID, name, one-line goal, what becomes testable.
   - A Mermaid flowchart of phase progression.

## 2. Assumptions & Prerequisites
   - Environment, access (data-store connection shape, auth info pending), tooling versions
     (from PROJECT_CONTEXT target stack).

## 3. Phases
   - One subsection per phase, using the phase template below.
   - (Live status is NOT tracked here — it lives in state.json. This section is the phases'
     content/specification only.)

## 4. Risks & Open Questions
   - Especially around any DB-reuse and auth constraints; plus anything unclear in the design.

## 5. Traceability Matrix
   - Table: requirement ID / design element → phase(s) & task ID(s). Every item covered by
     the final phase.
```

> **Note vs. earlier sets:** the status board and change log are **not** Markdown tables in
> Set4 — they are `state.json` (`phases[]`, `changeLog[]`). This makes branching and "redo
> from a stage" tractable. You initialize `phases[]`; the change log is appended by the
> Implement/Review stages and the developer.

### Phase template (use for every phase in §3)
```markdown
## Phase <P-N>: <Name>
- **Goal:** what this phase achieves, in one or two sentences.
- **Builds on:** <previous phase(s)> — what is assumed already working.
- **In scope:** the design elements / requirement IDs delivered.
- **Out of scope (deferred):** things a reader might expect here but that come later — name
  the phase they land in.
- **Replaces/removes:** any temporary artifact from earlier phases this supersedes, or "nothing".

### Tasks
  <task list using the task template>

### What is testable after this phase
- A short statement of the runnable state.

### Developer test guide
- Numbered manual steps: how to start it, what to open/call, what to do, expected result.
  Concrete: commands, URLs, example payloads, credential source (dev stub users, etc.).

### Exit criteria (mechanical — the agent gate)
- [ ] Falsifiable checks only: build green; tests pass; quality gate passes; the phase's
      endpoints/screens behave per the LLD; constraint checks hold (e.g. DB mapping validates);
      this phase's traceability rows are covered.
```

### Task template (use for every task)
```markdown
#### [P-N.T-M] <Short task title>
- **Depends on:** <task IDs, or "none">
- **Implements:** <design element(s)> / <requirement ID(s)>
- **Scope:** what to build (entities/endpoints/components/files involved).
- **Details:** specifics the coding agent needs — names, signatures, contracts to honor,
  edge cases. Reference the LLD rather than restating it where possible.
- **Acceptance criteria:** concrete, checkable conditions for "done".
- **Verification:** how to prove it (command to run, test to add, endpoint to call, screen).
```

### Conventions
- Phase IDs `P-1`, `P-2`, …; task IDs `P-N.T-M` — stable, referenced in dependencies,
  traceability, and `state.json`.
- Keep data entity/column names exactly as in the design/DB where a DB-reuse constraint applies.
- Prefix unresolved items `OPEN QUESTION:`, inferred ones `ASSUMPTION:`.
- Diagrams in Mermaid, fenced, with captions.

## Rerunning this Stage

If the human is unhappy with the slicing, they rerun with **Additional Instructions** (below)
— e.g. "make P-1 smaller", "pull reporting earlier", "use vertical slices". On rerun: re-slice
the **remaining (non-`accepted`) phases only** — completed phases in `state.json` are history.
Update `PLAN_<AppName>.md` and re-sync `phases[]` for the future phases, preserving accepted
ones. Increment `stages.plan.rerunCount` and add a `changeLog` entry noting the re-slice.

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Phase 1 is a genuinely small, runnable, locally testable increment — not half the app.
- [ ] Every phase ends runnable and manually testable, with a concrete developer test guide.
- [ ] Every design element and requirement ID maps to a phase/task (matrix complete).
- [ ] Phases build monotonically — no phase breaks a previous one, except marked replacements.
- [ ] The first data-store phase validates the mapping where a DB-reuse constraint applies.
- [ ] Auth lands early per the chosen path; the quality gate is wired in the scaffold phase;
      CI/CD handled per the context mode.
- [ ] **Exit criteria are mechanical/falsifiable** for every phase (the agent gate has teeth).
- [ ] Each task has scope, acceptance criteria, and a verification step.
- [ ] `state.json phases[]` is populated (all `pending`, `branchedFrom: null`).
- [ ] Risks and open questions listed, not silently resolved.
- [ ] `stages.plan.status` set to `complete`.
- [ ] A coding agent could execute any single phase from the plan + design docs alone.

## Additional Instructions

*(The prompt may append app-specific guidance — design/requirements/context/state file paths,
the output location, a preferred phase count or strategy, priority order, in/out-of-scope
items, or — on a rerun — the human's change requests. Treat these as overrides/additions.)*
