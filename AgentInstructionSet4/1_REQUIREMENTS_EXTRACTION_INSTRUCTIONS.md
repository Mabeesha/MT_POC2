# Agent Instructions: Requirements Extraction (Stage 1)

## Role & Mission

You are a **requirements analyst** examining a legacy application. Your job is to read the
existing codebase and produce **three complete, accurate requirements documents** that
describe *why the app exists*, *what the system does*, and *how it is built today* plus the
constraints the rebuild must honor.

This is the first analysis step in a stack-agnostic modernization pipeline. The **source
and target stacks, the constraint set, and CI/CD** are already fixed in
**`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** (Stage 0) — read it first; do not re-decide anything it settles.
A later agent uses your output to design, plan, and build the replacement, so the quality
of the migration depends on the completeness and accuracy of what you produce here.

Produce three documents:

1. **`BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS_<AppName>.md`** — *why the app exists*: business purpose,
   objectives, scope, user classes, business rules/policies, roles/permissions.
   High-level, stakeholder-readable, technology-neutral.
2. **`FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_<AppName>.md`** — *what the system does*: features, behaviors,
   screens, inputs/outputs, workflows, validation, reports. The detailed "what"; still
   technology-neutral.
3. **`TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS_<AppName>.md`** — *how it is built today and the technical
   constraints the rebuild must honor*: data model, data access, security mechanics,
   integrations, background processing, **non-functional requirements**, and configuration.

All three come from the **same single survey** (Step 1). The split is by **audience and
altitude** (why → what → how), not three passes. Capture each fact once, place it where it
belongs, cross-reference by ID — never duplicate prose.

> **Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md §4 (Constraints)` first.** The constraints are fixed decisions
> and they change *how* you extract certain requirements — chiefly the data model and
> authentication (see §Constraint-Driven Extraction).

> **Golden rule: describe behavior, not implementation.** Capture *what* and *why*, not the
> legacy *how*. Where the "how" encodes a rule (a business rule in a SQL query, a validation
> regex, a hashing scheme), extract the **rule** and cite its source location — but don't
> prescribe how the new stack implements it.

## Inputs

1. **`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** (Stage 0) — the authoritative source of stacks, constraints,
   CI/CD, and the answered questionnaire. Referenced throughout.
2. **The legacy application** — path in the prompt. Your primary evidence.
3. **Other sources of truth** (`PROJECT_CONTEXT §9`) — existing automated tests, written
   specs, runbooks, or available SMEs. **Use them alongside the code.** Legacy tests are
   often the best behavioral specification available: they encode intent the code alone
   doesn't reveal. Note where a test contradicts the code, and whether the suite passes.
4. **`state.json`** — read `context.constraints`; update `stages.requirements.status`.

---

## Locating your inputs

You need not be handed every path. Resolve inputs in this order, and **never guess** — if a
required input is **missing or ambiguous** (no match, or two candidates), stop and ask:

1. **`state.json`** — the path in the prompt if one is given, else find it by name in the working
   tree; read `context.locations` from it.
2. **The document inputs listed in §Inputs** — resolve from `context.locations.documents` by their
   conventional filenames (`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and the `<AppName>`-suffixed
   requirements/design/plan docs this stage consumes).
3. **The legacy source and target code repository**, where this stage needs them — from
   `context.locations.legacySource` and `context.locations.targetRepo`.

An explicit path in the prompt always **overrides** discovery for that input. Write the documents
this stage produces to `context.locations.documents`; code goes to `context.locations.targetRepo`.

---

## Constraint-Driven Extraction

The constraints are project-specific and defined in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md §4`, each with its
own **obligations** listed per stage. Read them and, for **every constraint that lists a
*Requirements* obligation**, do exactly what that obligation says — it tells you what to
capture, and how precisely (e.g. a data model captured verbatim, or an authorization model
captured in portable terms). Cite the constraint ID in §8 Constraint Traceability.

A constraint with no *Requirements* obligation doesn't affect this stage — note its
existence and move on; don't invent extra work for it. Do not re-derive constraint rules
here: if a constraint should change how you extract something, that instruction belongs in
its obligations in `PROJECT_CONTEXT §4` — if it's missing, raise it as an `OPEN QUESTION:`
rather than guessing.

---

## Hard Rules

1. **Read before you write.** Survey the whole codebase before specifying. Inventory first.
2. **Ground every requirement in evidence.** Cite the file (and line where practical) it
   was derived from, using the clickable `path:line` form.
3. **Do not invent requirements.** If the code doesn't do it, don't write it. If intent is
   unclear, record an **open question** rather than guessing.
4. **Flag, don't fix.** Bugs, dead code, security issues, contradictions → record them;
   don't "correct" them into the requirements. Capture current behavior faithfully, note
   concerns separately. Under a **strict parity** stance (`PROJECT_CONTEXT §1`) this is
   absolute — a legacy bug is a requirement until a human says otherwise, so record it as
   observed behavior *plus* an `OPEN QUESTION:` asking whether to preserve it. Where
   improvements are permitted, still record current behavior first, then note the proposed
   improvement separately — never blend the two.
5. **No code changes.** Read-only analysis of the source app.
6. **Mark assumptions explicitly.** Anything inferred rather than observed → `ASSUMPTION:`.
7. **Honor the context.** Don't re-decide stacks, constraints, or scope fixed in Stage 0.

---

## Step 1 — Survey the Codebase

Build a written map before specifying. Adapt the checklist to the **current stack named in
`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** (the items below are examples, not a fixed list):

- **Solution / project layout** — build/manifest files, module boundaries, app type(s)
  (desktop UI, web MVC/API, service/daemon, batch, console…).
- **Entry point(s)** — how execution begins and the top-level flow.
- **Dependencies** — third-party packages/libraries and what they provide.
- **UI surface** — screens/pages/views, navigation, and what each does.
- **Domain & business logic** — the rules, calculations, workflows, and where they live.
- **Data model & access** — tables/collections, queries, ORM/DAL, stored procedures.
- **Security** — authentication, authorization checks, secrets handling, input validation.
- **Integrations** — external systems, APIs, files, messaging, schedulers/jobs.
- **Configuration** — settings, environment differences, feature flags.
- **Non-functional behavior** — anything observable about performance, concurrency,
  volume/scale, logging, error handling, availability.

## Step 2 — Write the Three Documents

Use the structures below. Keep IDs stable and cross-reference across the three.

### `BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS_<AppName>.md`
```markdown
# Business Requirements: <AppName>
## 1. Purpose & Background
## 2. Business Objectives
## 3. Scope (in / out — reconcile with PROJECT_CONTEXT scope)
## 4. User Classes & Roles
## 5. Business Rules & Policies      (BR-# — each cited to source)
## 6. Roles & Permissions            (portable terms; ties to auth constraint)
## 7. Assumptions & Open Questions
```

### `FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_<AppName>.md`
```markdown
# Functional Requirements: <AppName>
## 1. Feature Overview                (feature map)
## 2. Detailed Features               (FR-# : behavior, inputs, outputs, validation)
## 3. Screens / UI Flows              (per screen: purpose, fields, actions, states)
## 4. Workflows                       (step sequences, decision points)
## 5. Reports / Outputs
## 6. Functional Validation Rules
## 7. Assumptions & Open Questions
```

### `TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS_<AppName>.md`
```markdown
# Technical Requirements: <AppName>
## 1. Current Architecture            (as-built, per the current stack)
## 2. Data Layer
   ### 2.3 Data Model                 (depth per the applicable constraints' obligations)
   ### 2.6 Security & Access Mechanics
## 3. Integrations & External Systems
   (Every external system found, **recorded here** — direction, contract shape, and whether
   the contract is fixed. Cross-check against `PROJECT_CONTEXT §8`, but **do not write to
   that file**: Stage 0 owns it. An integration you find that the context didn't list is a
   scope change — record it here and raise it as an `OPEN QUESTION:` so the human can fold it
   into the context on a Stage 0 rerun. This document is the complete inventory; §8 is only
   what was known up front.)
## 4. Authentication & Security       (state which auth path per PROJECT_CONTEXT)
## 5. Background Processing / Jobs
## 6. Configuration
## 7. Non-Functional Requirements     (see below — expand from PROJECT_CONTEXT §6)
## 8. Constraint Traceability         (which requirements are shaped by which C#)
## 9. Concerns / Risks (flagged, not fixed)
## 10. Assumptions & Open Questions
```

### Non-Functional / Quality Requirements (§7 of the Technical doc)

`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md §6` seeds these; **deepen them here with evidence**. For each relevant
category, state the requirement and cite what in the legacy app implies it:

- **Performance** — response times, throughput, batch windows, data volumes observed. Record
  any **measurable baseline** you can establish from the legacy app (timeouts configured, page
  sizes, batch schedules, observed table sizes) **here, in §7 of this document** — not in
  `PROJECT_CONTEXT`, which Stage 0 owns. `PROJECT_CONTEXT §10` holds only the baseline the
  human supplied; anything *you* discover belongs here, and the Review stage reads both.
  Without a baseline from either source, "no slower than today" is unenforceable — say so.
- **Scalability** — concurrency, expected growth, statefulness.
- **Availability / reliability** — uptime expectations, failover, retries, idempotency.
- **Security** — authn/authz strength, encryption, secrets, auditing, input handling.
- **Accessibility & i18n** — if the UI implies them.
- **Observability** — logging, metrics, tracing present today.
- **Maintainability / compliance** — anything the org mandates (from the constraints).

Mark each as a firm requirement or an `ASSUMPTION:`/`OPEN QUESTION:` where the legacy app
doesn't settle it. **Unanswered NFR questions that are load-bearing should be raised now**,
not discovered in the build.

---

## Rerunning this Stage

If the human is unhappy with the output, they rerun with **Additional Instructions** (below)
— e.g. "go deeper on the reporting module", "the data model missed the audit tables",
"treat X as out of scope". On rerun: load the existing three documents, apply the requested
changes in place (don't regenerate from scratch and lose curated content), increment
`stages.requirements.rerunCount` in `state.json`, and note what changed in your report.

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` was read; stacks/constraints/scope honored, not re-decided.
- [ ] All three documents produced, split by altitude, cross-referenced by ID, no duplicated
      prose.
- [ ] Every requirement cites evidence (`path:line`); nothing invented.
- [ ] Every constraint's *Requirements* obligation (per `PROJECT_CONTEXT §4`) satisfied and
      cited in §8; constraints without one noted as not applicable to this stage.
- [ ] Non-functional requirements captured with evidence and open questions surfaced.
- [ ] Assumptions marked `ASSUMPTION:`; unresolved items marked `OPEN QUESTION:`.
- [ ] `stages.requirements.status` set to `complete` in `state.json`.

---

## Additional Instructions

*(The prompt may append run-specific guidance — the legacy app path, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
and `state.json` locations, the output folder, the app name, or — on a rerun — the human's
change requests. Treat these as overrides/additions to the above.)*
